# Algorithms
This is a catalogue of some of the algorithms I have learnt.  This respository serves three purposes:
1. Storage and display of my personal implementations of these algorithms
2. As a reference to study and learn how these algorithms work
3. To demonstrate how these algorithms could be implemented to refrence if trying to implement them yourself

Notes:
- I have where possible avoided using any libraries outside of python's inbuilt ones
- Not all these implementations have been peer reviewed or verified
- Each folder contains a README.md that gives a description on how the algorithm works and how to use my implementation
